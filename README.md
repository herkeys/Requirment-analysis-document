This project aims to develop a working prototype of H-Scan, an AI-based methodology and software system carrying out Automated Horizon Scanning -- the identification of early-stage signals of impending significant and relevant changes in human technology, society or culture.  The prototype H-Scan systemâ€™s functionality will be demonstrated via applying it to historical textual data to observe how it would have performed had it been applied historically.
